# What is a blockchain ?
- A blockchain is a digital record of transactions distributed and shared among the nodes of a computer network. 
Each transaction in the blockchain is call a block and links to another with cryptography techniques.

- You can also think of a blockchain as a special kind of distributed database. In this database, 
each record is unique and immutable, and very record (except the first) contains a reference to the record that came before it. 
Every record has a hash that identifies the record and ensures that any tampering done to it can be detected.
Every device that's a part of this network contains a copy of the database. and multiple devices have to agree 
that a record is valid using a consensus mechanism before it can be added to the database.

Here's a visual example to illustrate the concept:
